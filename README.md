# NLTK-class-project


Class project to try and guess the author of a book using language analysis in python.

The project uses things such as average sentence length, and lexical diversity to try and guess (given a mystery file) the author of a book. 
This project uses Python's Natural language toolkit to parse books from the gutenburg project. Given the file it will find the paramaters which can possibly distinguish authors from one another. 

To run project nltk and its corpora must be downloaded during its first run, afterwards any mystery file can be added and it will try to guess which one of the authors in our current corpora wrote the passage or book that your are giving it.

This was my first programming project, and my first python project. I learned how to make sure our methods worked with each other, and it was my first time applying the basics of computer programming to anything bigger than a method. This project is based heavily in linguistics, and I learned much about how we can use programs to parse human speech.
